# JIRA Ticket Time Estimation: Mental Model

This document provides a conceptual overview of the JIRA Ticket Time Estimation system.

## Core Concept

The JIRA Ticket Time Estimation system uses machine learning to predict how long it will take to complete JIRA tickets. It does this by analyzing historical ticket data and learning patterns between ticket descriptions and their actual completion times.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Collection
The system fetches historical ticket data from JIRA, including descriptions, titles, and actual completion times. This data forms the foundation for training the prediction models.

### 2. Text Processing
Ticket text (descriptions, titles, etc.) is processed and converted into numerical embeddings using OpenAI's API. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text in a format that machine learning models can understand.

### 3. Model Training
The system supports multiple types of prediction models:
- Linear Regression: A simple model that assumes a linear relationship between features and completion time
- Random Forest: An ensemble model that can capture non-linear relationships
- Neural Network: A deep learning approach for complex pattern recognition

### 4. Prediction
Once trained, the models can predict completion times for new tickets based on their text content.

## Conceptual Flow

1. Historical ticket data is fetched from JIRA
2. Text from tickets is converted to numerical embeddings
3. Models are trained on this data to recognize patterns
4. New tickets are processed in the same way
5. The trained model predicts completion time for new tickets

## Design Philosophy

The system is designed with several key principles in mind:
- **Efficiency**: Data caching and incremental updates minimize API calls
- **Flexibility**: Support for multiple model types allows for different approaches
- **Accuracy**: Cross-validation and multiple metrics ensure reliable predictions
- **Usability**: Command-line interface with sensible defaults makes the system easy to use

## When to Use Each Model Type

- **Linear Regression**: Best for simple datasets with clear linear relationships. Fastest to train and easiest to interpret.
- **Random Forest**: Good for capturing non-linear relationships and handling outliers. More robust than linear regression.
- **Neural Network**: Best for large datasets with complex patterns. Requires more data and tuning but can achieve higher accuracy.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Machine learning models have configuration settings (hyperparameters) that affect their performance. The system includes automated hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest models to find optimal settings without manual trial and error.

The tuning process:
1. Systematically tests different parameter combinations
2. Measures how each combination affects prediction accuracy
3. Intelligently narrows the search toward better-performing configurations
4. Identifies which parameters have the most impact on performance

This automated approach saves time and improves model accuracy by finding parameter combinations that humans might overlook. The system handles this complexity behind the scenes, allowing users to benefit from optimized models without needing to understand the technical details of the tuning process.
